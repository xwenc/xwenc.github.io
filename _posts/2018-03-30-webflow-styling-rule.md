1. The orange indicators mean.
2. The blue  indicators mean.
3. Combo classes.

In the Style Panel, orange indicators tell us that a value is being inherited from somewhere else. If we click that orange indicator, we can see exactly where the style is coming from.

If our current class or tag has its own value for something, that's indicated in blue.

So when we collapse these style sections — when these panes are collapsed, the blue and orange indicators are giving us a quick overview so we can glance and see what's affecting the current class or tag.

Now, we can also use the Inheritance Menu to quickly visualize and select from the different classes and tags affecting our current styling. We can make a change — in this case we're changing the font — then, at any time, go right back to where we were styling.

So. We have the top section which contains our Selector field: show's what we're styling.

We have our style sections, which can collapse or expand — these panes give us control over all our CSS properties — all our styling options.

And finally, we have orange and blue indicators. Orange means whatever we're styling is inheriting a value from something else, and blue means we've added or styled something on the current class or tag.

We'll cover all of this comprehensively — but this is a good overview of the layout and the anatomy of the Style Panel.

Sometimes it's impractical to create separate classes every time you want to make a change. If we've taken the time to create the most glorious heading on the planet, and we want to use that class as a starting point for a variation? If we want the same thing somewhere else but in light blue? We could create a new class and go through the entire process again. Or we can use a Combo Class.
